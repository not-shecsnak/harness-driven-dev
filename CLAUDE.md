# CLAUDE.md — Harness-Driven Development

## Project

This is a demo Task Board (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS) used to demonstrate
Harness-Driven Development: an approach where an AI agent enforces
software best practices mechanically via scripts, hooks, and gates.

The harness connects Linear (project management) with GitHub (code)
through automated enforcement.

## Skills

The agent has 6 skills that connect with the harness:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/create-issue <title>` | Create a new issue in Linear with acceptance criteria. |
| `/start-issue DEMO-X` | ALWAYS before writing code. Reads Linear issue, creates branch, moves to In Progress. |
| `/close-issue DEMO-X` | ALWAYS to finish work. Runs 3 gates (tests + CI + criteria), posts evidence, moves to Done. |
| `/fix-secret` | When gitleaks blocks a commit. Moves the secret to env, asks the user to populate `.env`, WAITS for confirmation before retrying. |
| `/status` | Check project dashboard: issues, branch, CI status. |
| `/agent-metrics` | Per-agent table: tickets closed, avg cycle time, % gates passed first try. |

> **Note**: `DEMO-X` is used as an example. Replace with your actual Linear team key prefix (e.g., `HAR-5`, `EXP-1`). The team key is set when you create your team in Linear.

## Harness Rules

1. **No code without issue**: Before touching code, run `/start-issue`.
2. **Refs, never Closes**: Commit messages MUST contain `Refs DEMO-XXX`.
   NEVER use `Closes`, `Fixes`, or `Resolves` — they bypass harness gates.
3. **Mechanical Definition of Done**: Use `/close-issue` to close issues.
   NEVER close manually in Linear. The harness runs 3 gates first.
4. **No secrets in code**: gitleaks blocks commits with secrets
   automatically. When it blocks, follow the **Secret Blocked Flow**
   below — never bypass it with `--no-verify`.
5. **Evidence always**: Every issue closure includes an audit trail comment in Linear.

## Secret Blocked Flow

When gitleaks blocks a commit because a secret was hardcoded, run the
`/fix-secret` skill. This flow is mandatory and non-negotiable:

1. Remove the secret from the code; read it from an environment variable.
2. Ensure `.env.example` documents the variable name (placeholder only).
3. **Ask the user to put the real value in `.env`, then STOP.**
4. **WAIT for the user's explicit confirmation** that `.env` is ready.
   The agent MUST NOT retry the commit before this confirmation.
5. Retry the commit (now clean) and continue (push → PR → `/close-issue`).

The agent NEVER reads, writes, or creates `.env` — the user owns secrets.

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body>

Refs DEMO-XXX
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `refactor`

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/linear_client.py` | GraphQL client for Linear API (get, move, comment, list) |
| `scripts/close_issue.sh` | Gate script: tests + CI + acceptance criteria |
| `scripts/check_issue_ref.sh` | Commit-msg hook: enforces `Refs DEMO-XXX` |
| `scripts/ci_failure_bridge.py` | Auto-creates Linear bug when CI fails |

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML + CSS + vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- Tests: Node.js + jsdom
- Harness scripts: Python 3 (stdlib only) + Bash
- CI: GitHub Actions
- Project management: Linear
